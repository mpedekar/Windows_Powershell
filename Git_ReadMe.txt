******
day to day to work

git switch mpedekar_dev
git push -u origin mpedekar_dev  - -u means set upstream tracking. It tells Git: This local branch should track origin/my_work_branch.”

After doing this once, Git remembers the connection.
git merge main  - This will merge from main branch to this branch only.

DO NOT RUN
git switch main   - You will switch to main repo.
git merge mpedekar_dev  -- This will merge from this merge to main branch only to the local repo.
git push origin main -- This will push changes from local repo to remote
>>>>>>> main
